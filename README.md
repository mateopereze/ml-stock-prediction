# ml-stock-prediction
This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of how different types of models perform in stock market prediction. By comparing statistical models like ARIMA with machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (LSTM), we can gain insights into which techniques are most effective for predicting stock prices in various market conditions.


## Dataset
Using market data from YFinance to bring and create new categories who are considering so important for the model and make the predictions best.


## Multiple Model Types
A variety of modeling techniques are applied to the stock data:
- Statistical Models (e.g., ARIMA)
- Machine Learning Models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Mixed Models (combination of statistical and ML approaches)
- Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, CNN)


## Model Comparison
A key feature is comparing the performance of these different models, evaluating their accuracy, and understanding their individual strengths and weaknesses in forecasting stock prices.


## Installation and configuration

1. Python 3.11 is recommended for this project. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python 3.11 Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. It is advised to set up the project in a [__virtual environment__] to isolate dependencies. Inside the project directory, you'll find the ```PyEnv.bat``` executable. Running this will create a virtual environment in the project folder and automatically install the necessary dependencies as specified in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
