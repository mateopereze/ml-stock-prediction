# ml-stock-prediction
This project aims to demonstrate the application of long short-term memory (LSTM) using market data, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.


## Dataset
Using market data from YFinance to bring and create new categories who are considering so important for the model and make the predictions best.


## Multiple Model Types
A variety of modeling techniques are applied to the stock data:
- Statistical Models (e.g., ARIMA)
- Machine Learning Models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Mixed Models (combination of statistical and ML approaches)
- Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, CNN)


## Model Comparison
A key feature is comparing the performance of these different models, evaluating their accuracy, and understanding their individual strengths and weaknesses in forecasting stock prices.


## Installation and configuration

1. Python 3.11 is recommended for this project. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python 3.11 Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. It is advised to set up the project in a [__virtual environment__] to isolate dependencies. Inside the project directory, you'll find the ```PyEnv.bat``` executable. Running this will create a virtual environment in the project folder and automatically install the necessary dependencies as specified in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
